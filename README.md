# wear-os-better-flashlight

## Inspiration

Because the default flashlight app on the wear os is *WHITE* only. I want the flashlight to be easier on the eyes during the night so I include *RED* as a option.

## How it work

press top button -> WHITE
press bottom button -> RED

press again to turn the light off
